# Multi-Target-Regression
Simple linear regression is amplified in multiple regression. Multi-target regression is a regression issue in which two or more numerical values are predicted for a single input. In most cases, outputs are dependent on both input and each other. Multi-target regression is a supervised learning technique in which the aim is to predict multiple target variables from a set of common input variables. The task is known as multi-label classification when the prediction goals are binary, and multi-target regression when the targets are continuous. 


The most popular regression machine learning algorithms which support multiple outputs are:
    Linear Regression
    KNeighbors Regressor
    Decision Tree Regression
    Random Forest Regression
